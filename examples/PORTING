1. #show => #misc#show
2. #grab_default => #misc#grab_default

3. Separator/Box:
     #pack => #add
     #pack ~padding:5 => (fun w -> hbox#pack_start w false true (*~padding:*)5)
4. Notebook:
     #append_page w => #append_page w None
     #switch_page (fun i -> ..) => #switch_page (fun w i -> ..)

5. #PPP => #get_PPP per le propriet√† PPP Read

5. a window w is not a #container, but it can be casted to it
   (e.g. in example button.ml). It used to be a #container instead.
   The problem is due to #connect: window signals inherit from container
   signals, but a cast is required. How did it work without before?

6. adjustments only at the low level: add #as_adjustment where there should
   be no one (e.g. counter.ml)


============= TO TEST ==================
1. output of button.exe: is it the expected one?
   same for counter.exe: maybe wrong default somewhere?

============= TODO (XXX) ==================
1. radiobutton.ml: #get_group
2. entry.ml: #select_region
3. button.ml: ~use_mnemonic ~stock

============= Bugs ==================
0. Calendar: get_date ritorna uno unit di troppo
   (gestione parametri di I/O per funzioni che tornano void errata?)
1. RadioButtonG get_group not implemented (GSList *)
2. Inheritance from interfaces not implemented (e.g. Entry is an Editable)
3. Additional constructors not implemented (e.g. Buttong.new_with_mnemonic)
4. Adjustments only exist at the low level
   File "counter.ml", line 28, characters 37-40:
   28 | let sc = HScaleG.h_scale ~adjustment:adj ~draw_value:false
   Error: This expression has type GData.adjustment
          but an expression was expected of type Types.adjustment Gtk.obj


============= Notes ==================
1. Widget.size_params is an exeption w.r.t. Widget.make_params
   Consequence:use ~width in place of ~width_request.
   Why??
